#' Calculating Service Times For Customers At A Bank

#' @description This package will outline which server is available first for a certain customer.

#' @param Arrivals text string; Time the customer first arrives.
#' @param ServiceTimes text string; The total duration of service, i.e., difference between the start time of service and the end time of service.
#' @param NumServers text string; The number of servers available to serve customers

#' @return data frame

Multiserver <- function(Arrivals, ServiceTimes, NumServers = 1) {
  if (any(Arrivals <= 0 | ServiceTimes <= 0) || NumServers <= 0){

  # Feed customers through a multiserver queue system to determine each
  # customer's transition times.

  NumCust = length(Arrivals)  #  number of customer arrivals
  # When each server is next available (this will be updated as the simulation proceeds):
  AvailableFrom <- rep(0, NumServers)
  # i.e., when the nth server will next be available

  # These variables will be filled up as the simulation proceeds:
  ChosenServer <- ServiceBegins <- ServiceEnds <- rep(0, NumCust)

  # ChosenServer = which server the ith customer will use
  # ServiceBegins = when the ith customer's service starts
  # ServiceEnds = when the ith customer's service ends

  # This loop calculates the queue system's "Transitions by Customer":
  for (i in seq_along(Arrivals)){
    # go to next available server
    avail <-  min(AvailableFrom)
    ChosenServer[i] <- which.min(AvailableFrom)
    # service begins as soon as server & customer are both ready
    ServiceBegins[i] <- max(avail, Arrivals[i])
    ServiceEnds[i] <- ServiceBegins[i] + ServiceTimes[i]
    # server becomes available again after serving ith customer
    AvailableFrom[ChosenServer[i]] <- ServiceEnds[i]
